Study is a service that helps you with organizing your education.
You can work alone or in the group - add your classmates and you will never forget about tomorrow's exam!

**Check it live at [studyapp.pw](https://studyapp.pw/)**

**Note:** Project made for educational purposes only, external library testing at real environment and to show Django awesomeness.
The code is not fully production quality - most of it was written on extreme programming sessions.


Submodules
----------

Study is contributed with other people who can add own functions.
These functions are separated to microservices bacause they are written in other languages.


TODO
----

- Move external static libraries to Bower & Grunt
